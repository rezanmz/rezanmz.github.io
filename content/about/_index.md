I recently completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at the Sharif University of Technology - Kish International Campus. My research interest lies at the intersection of deep learning on graphs, natural language processing, and representation learning. I am primarily interested in working on interdisciplinary research projects solving real-world problems.

Currently, I am working on applying graph neural networks to natural language processing under the supervision of [Dr Hamidreza Mahyar][1].
