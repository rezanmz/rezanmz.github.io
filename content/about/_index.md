My current research is concentrated on leveraging graph neural networks for advancing natural language processing techniques. This work is being carried out under the guidance of [Dr. Hamidreza Mahyar][1]. I am passionate about interdisciplinary projects that bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world applications, aiming to solve complex problems through innovative AI solutions.

In addition to my academic background, I have gained practical experience through various internships and research assistant roles. At BASF, as a Research Intern, I am involved in data-driven initiatives and collaborated with the Generative AI team, focusing on sophisticated analytics and predictive modeling. As a Machine Learning Associate at both EthicalAI Inc. and Vector Institute, I am working on applying my skills in data analysis, time series forecasting, and machine learning to various research projects.
